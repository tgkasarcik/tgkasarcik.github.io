# Tommy Kasarcik's Personal Portfolio Website

This website is intended to be a portfolio of the projects I have created that I am the most proud of.  I intend this site to grow and change as I create more projects and develop more skills.

This version of the website is created from raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.  The background animation is created using the p5.js library from https://p5js.org/
